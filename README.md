# FYP-Avalon

I created an Android app which was an adaptation of the board game “The Resistance: Avalon”. 
The app retained many of the original game-play mechanics while replacing the need for the board game's physical components such as cards, tokens and scripts. 
The app is local multi-player and uses Wi-Fi Direct, a wireless peer-to-peer technology built into Android devices, to connect 5-10 players, with each player using a separate Android device to play.

THIS PROJECT INCLUDED:
Writing a report which comprised of: Project background, research, methodologies, technology used, design, prototype and final implementation details, evaluation and references.
Creating the app which comprised of: Iterative development using both physical prototypes to show UI design and software prototypes used to test various APIs and technology. I then combined and expanded the prototypes to create the app.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
Java: Programmed in Java, the language Android uses.
Wi-Fi Direct: A standard created by the Wi-Fi Alliance that allows the setting up of a peer-to-peer network with other devices that implement the protocol.
Service Discovery: Used in conjunction with Wi-Fi Direct to enable the devices to find each other and filter out non-applicable devices.
KryoNet: An open source Java library that provides an API for dynamic TCP and UDP client/server network using NIO.
Fragments: Used to create many different views in the app.
XML: Used for the layout of the many different UI screens. 
Other features: enums, callbacks, intents, broadcasts receivers and input event listeners.

This project vastly improved my Java, Android, XML, research and report writing skills. 
I also greatly improved my presentation skills as I was required to give full working demonstrations of this app to my lecturers, supervisors, industry officials and classmates. 
The app was finished to a complete success and I was awarded an 'A1' grade for my final year project.
